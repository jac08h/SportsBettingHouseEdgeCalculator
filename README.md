# Sports Betting House Edge Calculator

* **What Is House Edge?**
    * House Edge is the mathematical advantage of the betting platform over the player.
* **How is the House Edge Calculated?**
    1. Calculate the probability for each game event by dividing 1 over the odds
    2. Sum up the probabilities
    3. Subtract one
    4. Multiply by 100 to get the House Edge percentage
* **Explanation**
    * Probabilities are calculated by dividing 1 over the odds - higher odds = lower probability.
    The sum of probabilities of all *mutually exclusive* events is 1, or 100%.
    If the odds didn't include an House Edge, the sum would be 1. However, if the sum is greater than 1, it follows that the odds would have to be *increased* to bring the sum of probabilities down to 1.
* **Example**
  * Odds:
    |Win Home|Tie|Win Away
    |-|-|-|
    |3.04|3.16|2.51
    1. Probabilities: 
        * Win Home: 1/3.04 = 0.328
        * Tie: 1/3.16 = 0.316
        * Win Away: 1/2.51 = 0.398
    2. Sum of probabilities = 0.328 + 0.316 + 0.398 = 1.042
    3. After subtracting one = 0.042
    4. House Edge = 4.2%
